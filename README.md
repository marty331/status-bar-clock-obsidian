# Status Bar Clock for Obsidian

This plugin simply adds a status bar clock to Obsidian.  I find myself working in full screen mode quite a bit and could not see the time, so I created this plugin.

## Options

One option (for now) - toggle showing the seconds in the clock.  With this turned off, the clock will show the hour: minutes AM/PM.  With this turned on this the clock will update every second and show hour : minutes : seconds AM/PM.
